_Keep in mind_: To find the tangent line of a function at a certain x value, send the request as c|f(x) where c is the given x value and f(x) is the function expression, the separator is a vertical bar '|'. See the table above for an example request.
To find the area under a function, send the request as c:d|f(x) where c is the starting x value, d is the ending x value, and f(x) is the function under which you want the curve between the two x values.
To compute fractions, enter expressions as numerator(over)denominator. For example, to process 2/4 you must send in your expression as 2(over)4. The result expression will be in standard math notation (1/2, 3/4).
